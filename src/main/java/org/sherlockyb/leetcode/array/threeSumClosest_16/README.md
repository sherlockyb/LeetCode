### 16. 3Sum Closest

Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

```
 For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

 The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

#### 思路（[代码](https://github.com/sherlockyb/LeetCode/blob/master/src/main/java/org/sherlockyb/leetcode/array/threeSumClosest/Solution.java)）

往往先排序，会有意想不到的效果。贪心策略，避免不必要的分支，将复杂度降低一个量级。
